# DevOps-App-Database
## Created a database using industry best practices. Developed an entity relationship diagram, converted into a database schema, and then implemented in SQLite. Wrote a custom script to generate realistic fake data. Then used it to populate the database with hundreds of thousands of tuples to demonstrate practical use and stability.
